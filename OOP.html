        <div style="height: 370px; color:aqua" class="description">Encapsulation is achieved when each object keeps its state private, inside a class. Other objects don’t have direct access to this state. Instead, they can only call a list of public functions — called methods.</div>

    <div class="flexbox-container">
        <div style="height: 550px;" class="description">Abstraction can be thought of as a natural extension of encapsulation.Applying abstraction means that each object should only expose a high-level mechanism for using it.This mechanism should hide internal implementation details. It should only reveal operations relevant for the other objects.</div>

        <div style="height: 425px; color: red;" class="description">Inheritance.It means that you create a (child) class by deriving from another (parent) class. This way, we form a hierarchy.The child class reuses all fields and methods of the parent class (common part) and can implement its own (unique part).</div>

    <div class="flexbox-container">
        <div style="height: 610px; color: blue;" class="description">Polymorphism gives a way to use a class exactly like its parent so there’s no confusion with mixing types. But each child class keeps its own methods as they are.This typically happens by defining a (parent) interface to be reused. It outlines a bunch of common methods. Then, each child class implements its own version of these methods.</div>
